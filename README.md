# 1. Brainstorm on research and design workflow

- My teammates and I were undergoing research like testing some of the e-stores with web scraping techniques.
- Find out whether the online shop is suitable for web scraping.
- Decide whether the website's product details are comparable such as the product's product_id, brand, volume, etc.
- Database content like determining how many tables and what should be stored inside the database.
- Some analytical questions/solutions should be answered after this project.
