Project Description:

An oversea online retailer client wants to expand their business to HongKong and they want to conduct market research and analysis for top local online retailers in the packaged food and beverage category

You would build your own data crawler, and store the crawled data in the database so that analysts and market researchers can use them to understand the competition better.

Eventually, you will need to present and demo your work(with example data) in a weekly company meeting, and show users what they can do with your tool in the next 24 months, audiences including both technical and less technical people(e.g. People from other team who might work with the client) 

Provide an analytical database for the client:

This project should also include the database schema, data structure design, and data storing in PostgreSQL or SQL server.
